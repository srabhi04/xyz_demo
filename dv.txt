4️⃣ Aggregate Functions & Calculated Fields — Step-by-step

Goal: practice SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, create custom calculated fields and parameters.

Open Tableau and connect to Sample - Superstore.xls. Drag Orders to the canvas and click Sheet 1.

Rename the sheet: double-click the sheet tab → type Agg_Sales_by_Category.

Create a simple aggregated bar chart
3. In the Data pane, drag Category → Columns.
4. Drag Sales → Rows. Tableau will use SUM(Sales) automatically.
5. Click the Show Me panel → select Bar (if not already bar).
6. Click the SUM(Sales) axis → Format or sort if needed (click the sort icon on the toolbar to sort desc).
7. Add labels: Toolbar → Label icon or from Marks card click Label → Show mark labels.

Example quick aggregates
8. To show AVG, MIN, MAX:

Right-click Sales on the Rows shelf → Measure → choose Average (AVG), then repeat in a new sheet for MIN and MAX.

Or duplicate the sheet (right-click tab → Duplicate) and change measure.

Create a custom calculated field — Profit Ratio
9. Click the down arrow in Data pane → Create Calculated Field...
10. Name it Profit Ratio. In formula box type:

SUM([Profit]) / SUM([Sales])


Click OK. A new measure Profit Ratio appears in Measures.

Build a chart: Drag Category → Columns, drag Profit Ratio → Rows.

Format percent: Right-click Profit Ratio pill → Default Properties → Number Format → Percentage → set decimals.

Create a parameter — Top N control
14. Right-click in Data → Create → Parameter...

Name: Top N

Data type: Integer

Current value: 5

Display: leave as is → Click OK.

Right-click the Top N parameter → Show Parameter (shows control on the right).

Use the parameter in a set to show Top N Sub-categories
16. Right-click Sub-Category → Create → Set...
17. In Set dialog → Top tab → Choose By field → Top: [Top N] by SUM(Sales) → Click OK.
18. Drag the new set (e.g., Top Sub-Category) to Filters or Rows to visualize only top N.

Tips / Why important

Aggregations (SUM/AVG) determine how rows combine to a single number.

SUM([Profit])/SUM([Sales]) returns correct aggregated ratio; avoid mixing aggregated and non-aggregated expressions incorrectly.

5️⃣ Table Calculations & LOD Calculations — Step-by-step

Goal: running totals, percent of total, YTD using table calcs; build FIXED/INCLUDE/EXCLUDE LOD expressions.

A. Table Calculations (Running Total, Percent of Total)

Create new sheet → rename TableCalc_RunningSales.

Drag Order Date → Columns. Right-click it → choose Month (or MONTH(Order Date) discrete) to show months.

Drag Sales → Rows. By default SUM(Sales).

Convert to line or bar as desired (Marks → Line).

Running Total
5. Right-click the SUM(Sales) pill on Rows → Quick Table Calculation → Running Total.
6. Running total will accumulate across the table.
7. To control partitioning: right-click SUM(Sales) pill → Edit Table Calculation...

In dialog choose Compute Using → Table (Across) or Table (Down) depending on layout.

To restart running total each year: in Edit Table Calculation → check Specific Dimensions → select Order Date (Year) as the partition (so it restarts by year).

Percent of Total
8. Duplicate sheet or create new sheet → TableCalc_PercentOfTotal.
9. Drag Category → Columns, Sales → Rows.
10. Right-click SUM(Sales) → Quick Table Calculation → Percent of Total.
11. Edit Table Calculation if needed to compute by Category across the table.

Year-To-Date (YTD) Sales using table calc
12. Create sheet YTD_Sales. Drag Order Date (Month) to Columns and Sales to Rows.
13. Apply Quick Table Calculation → Running Total.
14. Edit Table Calculation → set Restarting every to Order Date (Year) (or use Specific Dimensions and check Year). This computes a running total that restarts each year (YTD).

B. Level of Detail (LOD) Expressions

What they do: LOD expressions compute aggregations at a defined level, independent of view granularity.

Create FIXED LOD — State Sales
15. Create Calculated Field → name State Sales (LOD) with formula:

{ FIXED [State] : SUM([Sales]) }


Click OK. State Sales (LOD) appears as a measure (but it’s fixed-level aggregated).

Use LOD in view
17. New sheet LOD_StatePercent. Drag State → Rows.
18. Drag Sales → Columns (shows SUM Sales by State).
19. Drag State Sales (LOD) → Tooltip or Label if you want to see it.
20. Create another calculated field Pct of State Sales:

SUM([Sales]) / [State Sales (LOD)]


Drag Pct of State Sales → Label. Format as percentage.

INCLUDE / EXCLUDE examples
22. INCLUDE example (adds granularity to the aggregation even if view is coarser):

{ INCLUDE [Sub-Category] : SUM([Sales]) }


EXCLUDE example (removes a dimension from aggregation even if it's in the view):

{ EXCLUDE [Category] : SUM([Sales]) }


Create small test view: put Category and Sub-Category in Rows and compare SUM([Sales]) vs {FIXED [Category]: SUM([Sales])} to see differences.

Tips & checks

LOD results are computed before table calculations and filters (except context filters).

If your LOD doesn’t change when you change the view, that’s expected for FIXED.

Use View Data or labels to verify numbers.

6️⃣ Maps in Tableau — Step-by-step

Goal: create symbol maps, filled maps (choropleth), pie maps, and density maps.

Pre-check: make sure geographic fields recognized

In Data pane, ensure State has a globe icon. If not: right-click State → Geographic Role → State/Province.

A. Symbol Map (circles sized by Sales)

New sheet → rename Map_Symbol_Sales.

Drag State → Detail on the Marks card. Tableau will create generated latitude/longitude and a map.

Change mark type to Circle (Marks card → select Circle).

Drag Sales → Size to make circles proportional to Sales.

Drag Sales → Color to show intensity and State → Label if you want text.

Use map zoom + pan to focus on region. Add Tooltips: hover to see SUM(Sales).

B. Filled Map / Choropleth (color states by sales)

New sheet → Map_Filled_Sales.

Drag State → Detail. On Marks card choose Map (or Filled Map in newer versions).

Drag Sales → Color.

Click Color → Edit Colors → choose sequential palette (default okay).

Adjust Map Layers: top menu → Map → Map Layers → toggle labels, streets, land cover as you like.

C. Pie Map (showing composition in each state)

New sheet → Map_Pie_ByState.

Drag State → Detail. Tableau creates map points.

On Marks card, change mark type to Pie.

Drag Sales → Angle.

Drag Category → Color (so each pie slice = category).

Drag Sales → Size to scale pies by total sales.

Optionally add State to Label to display state names (but pies can get cluttered; use for few states).

D. Density Map (heat/density of points)

New sheet → Map_Density.

Drag State → Detail (or use postal code / city for finer granularity).

On Marks card choose Density. If Density is not shown, choose Map and then pick Density from the mark type dropdown.

Drag Sales to Color if supported; density often shows concentration of records — increase sample detail by using city or lat/long for more meaningful density.

E. Map interactions and tooltips
24. Add filters: Drag Region to Filters to allow users to filter map.
25. Add Highlight actions later when building dashboard so clicking a region highlights charts.

F. Troubleshooting

If map shows a single point or wrong locations: check values in State spelling match Tableau’s expected names (e.g., “New York” not “NY”).

If no map appears: ensure geographic role set and internet is available for background map tiles (Tableau may need network).

For very detailed spatial analysis (shapefiles / spatial joins): use the Spatial file connector (Shapefile / GeoJSON) and drag in the spatial file to the Data Source.

Final practice checklist & quick troubleshooting

Save each sheet with clear names.

For table calculations: always Edit Table Calculation and confirm Compute Using setting. Wrong compute-using = wrong result.

For LOD: try both FIXED and INCLUDE on the same view to see behavior differences.

For maps: always confirm Geographic Role and clean your state/city names if something is off.

If you want, I can now:

ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👏 Abhishek! Let’s now go through step-by-step beginner-friendly instructions for both:

👉 Practical 7: Advanced Analytics in Tableau
👉 Practical 8: Interactive Dashboards in Tableau

We’ll use the same dataset — Sample Superstore (Orders sheet) — and focus on making each step crystal clear for your practical lab or journal.

🧠 7️⃣ Advanced Analytics in Tableau

Goal: Add and interpret Trend Lines, Forecasting, Clustering, and Reference Lines using the Analytics pane.
Estimated time: 50–60 min

🧩 Step 1: Open Dataset

Open Tableau Desktop/Public.

Connect to Sample - Superstore.xls.

Drag Orders sheet → canvas → click Sheet 1.

📈 Step 2: Create a Sales Trend Chart

Rename the sheet → Sales Trend.

Drag Order Date → Columns.

Drag Sales → Rows.

Click on Show Me → Line Chart.

From the drop-down on Order Date, choose Month or Continuous Month for smooth trend.

📉 Step 3: Add Trend Line

Go to Analytics pane (next to Data pane on left sidebar).

Drag Trend Line → drop it onto the chart → select Linear.

Tableau adds a regression line with equation & R² value.

Hover over the line → you’ll see the model formula (like Sales = 12,000 + 300*Month).

🟢 Interpretation:

The slope shows the average increase in sales per month.

The R² value (0–1) indicates how well the line fits your data.

📊 Step 4: Add Forecast

In the same sheet, open Analytics pane again.

Drag Forecast → drop it onto the view.

Tableau automatically predicts future sales using exponential smoothing.

Hover → blue shaded area = forecast range (upper/lower bounds).

Right-click forecast → Forecast → Describe Forecast to see model details.

🟢 Tip: You can edit forecast length → Forecast → Options → choose Forecast Length (e.g., 6 months).

🧮 Step 5: Add Reference Lines

New sheet → rename it Profit vs Sales.

Drag Sales → Columns, Profit → Rows → Show Me → Scatter Plot.

From Analytics pane → drag Reference Line → drop onto the view → choose Table.

Choose to show Average Sales and Average Profit.

You’ll now see two reference lines (horizontal & vertical).

These divide chart into 4 quadrants (e.g., high-profit/high-sales vs low-profit/low-sales).

Optional: drag Category → Color to differentiate product groups.

🟢 Insight: Helps identify which categories fall in profitable or loss regions.

🧩 Step 6: Add Clusters

Stay in same scatter plot (Profit vs Sales).

Go to Analytics pane → drag Cluster → drop onto view.

Tableau auto-detects clusters (usually 2–4 groups).

You can edit: right-click the cluster legend → Edit Clusters → change number of clusters.

Each color now represents a cluster (group of states/products with similar profit-sales behavior).

🟢 Tip:

Tableau uses k-means clustering by default.

Try dragging Discount or Quantity into Detail before clustering to include more dimensions.

📑 Step 7: Save and Interpret

Save workbook (File → Save As → Advanced_Analytics_Superstore.twbx).

Write down insights, e.g.:

“Forecast shows upward trend; Technology products have highest profit cluster; Furniture category below average profit line.”

✅ End of Practical 7 Output Summary:

Charts Used: Line, Scatter

Analytics Applied: Trend line, Forecast, Cluster, Reference Line

Learned Concepts: Regression trend, time-series forecast, K-means clustering, performance quadrants

🧭 8️⃣ Interactive Dashboards in Tableau

Goal: Combine multiple sheets, add filters, buttons, and navigation to create an interactive dashboard.
Estimated time: 60–75 min

🧩 Step 1: Prepare the Component Sheets

You’ll create 3–4 charts before the dashboard.

(A) Sales by Category (Bar Chart)

Sheet → rename Sales by Category.

Drag Category → Columns, Sales → Rows → choose Bar Chart.

Show Labels → sort descending.

(B) Sales by Region (Map)
4. New sheet → rename Sales Map.
5. Drag State → Detail, Sales → Color → choose Filled Map.

(C) Sales over Time (Line Chart)
6. New sheet → rename Sales Trend.
7. Drag Order Date → Columns, Sales → Rows → choose Line Chart.

(D) Profit vs Sales (Scatter Plot)
8. New sheet → rename Profit vs Sales.
9. Drag Sales → Columns, Profit → Rows, Category → Color → choose Circle mark.

🧭 Step 2: Create Dashboard

Click New Dashboard icon (bottom tab with “window+plus” symbol).

Rename → Sales Dashboard.

On left side → you’ll see your 4 sheets under “Sheets”.

Drag them one by one onto the blank canvas.

🧩 Layout Tip:

Put the Line chart (Sales Trend) on top.

Place Bar chart (Sales by Category) and Map side by side below.

Put Scatter Plot at the bottom.

🪄 Step 3: Add Filters for Interactivity

Click on any chart (e.g., “Sales by Category”).

From top-right of the chart → click dropdown arrow → Use as Filter.

Now when you click a Category, other charts will filter automatically.

Repeat for Map or Trend chart if needed.

🟢 Tip:

Add common filters (like Region or Year) manually:

Drag Region → Filters, then right-click → Show Filter (in Dashboard view).

The filter will appear on the side panel.

🧭 Step 4: Add Navigation Buttons

From Objects pane (left bottom) → drag Button into the dashboard.

In the dialog → choose Navigate to another sheet (e.g., go to Profit vs Sales).

Give a label like “View Profit Analysis”.

Optionally, add another button to go Back to Main Dashboard.

🧮 Step 5: Add Titles, Legends, and Formatting

Double-click the dashboard title → write:

“Superstore Sales & Profit Interactive Dashboard”

Add text boxes for insights or headings (drag Text from Objects pane).

Format colors → choose consistent theme (avoid clutter).

Resize charts for equal alignment.

🟢 Pro Tip: Use Floating layout for precise arrangement.

📢 Step 6: Test the Interactivity

Click on Furniture category in bar chart → other charts update dynamically.

Select a region on the map → see filtered line and scatter charts.

Click “View Profit Analysis” button → navigate to deeper view.

📁 Step 7: Save & Publish

Save workbook as .twbx file (Packaged Workbook).

If using Tableau Public → click File → Save to Tableau Public → Sign In → Publish.

Optional: Export as Image/PDF for submission.

✅ End of Practical 8 Output Summary:

Dashboard Includes: 4 charts + interactive filters + navigation buttons.

Features Used: Filtering, Navigation, Layout design, Dashboard actions.

Outcome: Interactive sales analysis view with real-time chart updates.

Would you like me to now format both of these (7 & 8) into journal-style write-ups (Aim, Procedure, Result, Output Description, Insights) — so you can directly paste into your practical record file?
